How to check the CPDN control process from within a fortran model
===================================================================

Glenn Carver, CPDN, May/2026

This small code is designed to help fortran based models detect
when the CPDN control process is not running. This can happen if 
there is a bug in the CPDN controller code, like a memory fault. 
If this happens it often leaves the model running alone with no 
control, causing corruption in the slot directory when the client 
tries to restart the task (or another task).

Implementation
--------------

1. Place the two code files:

- cpdn_process_check.c
- cpdn_checkpid.f90

into a new code directory called 'cpdn' in the model src.

cpdn_checkpid.f90 is a fortran module that wraps the C code 
which does the process id check.

The fortran module code will attempt to read the CPDN progressfile
which is formatted as a fortran namelist which contains the PID
of the controller id.

2. Add the new source directory 'cpdn' to the build system.

2.1 OpenIFS:

The FCM build does not detect the dependency of the fortran
module on the C object file despite the explicit interface in the 
fortran module. To fix, modify the make/oifs-depend.fcm file and add
this line:

```
oifs.prop{dep.o}[cpdn/cpdn_checkpid.f90]     = cpdn_process_check.o
```
Then build OpenIFS in the normal way.

3. Implement the call at the start of the model's main timestep loop.
Something like:

```
    subroutine do_time_step
    use cpdn_checkpid_mod
    ....
    logical :: cpdn_is_running
    logical :: model_standalone

    do timestep = 1, nsteps
    .....
    call cpdn_checkpid( cpdn_is_running, model_standalone )

    if ( .not. cpdn_is_running .and. .not. model_standalone ) then
       print*,' ERROR: CPDN control process is NOT running. Aborting..'
       STOP 'ABORT'
    endif
    ... 
    end do
    ....
    end subroutine
```

Error conditions
----------------

The call to cpdn_checkpid() will read the cpdn_progressfile.txt on each call.
If on the first call on the first timestep, no cpdn_progressfile.txt file is 
found, the code assumes the model is running standalone so it can be run
outside of the cpdn controller without taking this code out.

On each subsequent call, if there is a progress file `cpdn_is_running` is set
FALSE and indicates an error if:

- cpdn_progressfile.txt is no longer found.
- an error occurred attempting to read cpdn_progressfile.txt.
- the CPDN control process id changed from the last time the file was read.
- the process identified by the PID in the cpdn_progressfile.txt is not running.
